## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

About setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) on iOS. However, there are some errors in our code because we used an older version of library code (flutter_local_notifications plugin) that does not detect some syntax errors in the new version. you need to correct it.
